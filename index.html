			<h2>So what the hecc is Puppertino?</h2>
			<p>Puppertino is a CSS framework, that mimics the look of MacOS and Human Guidelinnes, while adding it's own taste on things.<br> The focus of Puppertino is help you create a beautiful looking App or Website, and being <strong>small sized, cool looking and modular</strong>.<br><br> Puppertino allows you to use it with <strong>Bootstrap, SkeletonCSS, Flexbox Grid</strong> or any other major starting point for websites, without getting in the way. This also means that you don't have to expect Puppertino to have grids, rows or any of that.</p>

			<h2>Oh ok, so is just a MacOS theme?</h2>
			<p>Nope, I want to think of it like a <strong>theme for any starting point framework</strong> that allows you to <strong>create something that looks great without having the pain of it affecting the performance of your website</strong>. This means that there will be components that will be added by hand and not because they are from MacOS, in the same way, not every thing in the MacOS interface will be added to Puppertino. If I think people won't use it, I will not add it.</p>

			<h2>Focused on speed and performance</h2>
			<p>Yeah, yeah, I've said this already, but the thing is: Pupperino is in development and it will be on it for a long time, and the main goal is to make it as lightweight as possible, so any other framework like Animate.css won't be included in Pupperino. And you should be able to choose if you want only a certain part of Pupperino or if you want all the components.<br><br> Pupperino currently only needs the Raleway font from Google Fonts, but you can change it by changing the <code class="code">--font</code> variable in the CSS.<br><br> Pupperino (with all of it's components) should be able to fit on a Floppy disk, how retro!</p>
